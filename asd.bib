	abstract = {Species within the genus, Campylobacter, have emerged over the last three decades as significant clinical pathogens, particularly of human public health concern, where the majority of acute bacterial enteritis in the Western world is due to these organisms. Of particular concern are the species, C. jejuni and C. coli, which are responsible for most of these gastrointestinal-related infections. Although these organisms have already emerged as causative agents of zoonoses, several aspects of their epidemiology and pathophysiology are only beginning to emerge. Trends in increasing antibiotic resistance are beginning to emerge with oral antibiotics, which may be the drug of choice for when it is necessary to intervene chemotherapeutically. This review wishes to examine (i) emerging clinical aspects of the disease, such as Guillain Barré syndrome ({GBS}), (ii) the association between these organisms and poultry as a natural host, (iii) environmental aspects of Campylobacter epidemiology, (iv) the emergence of atypical campylobacters (v) emerging trends in antibiotic resistance, (vi) adoption of modern methods for the detection of campylobacters.},

	abstract = {Food of animal origin, especially meat products, represent the main vehicle of foodborne pathogens and so are implicated in foodborne outbreaks. Poultry meat is a widely consumed food in various forms, but it is also a reservoir of thermotolerant Campylobacter and Salmonella bacterial species. To assess human health risks associated with pathogenic bacteria in poultry meat, the use of quantitative microbial risk assessment ({QMRA}) has increased over the years as it is recognized to address complex food safety issues and is recommended by health authorities. The present project reviewed poultry meat {QMRA}, identified key steps of the farm-to-fork chain with significant impacts on food safety, highlighted current knowledge gaps, and provided risk mitigation advices. A {PRISMA} (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-based systematic analysis was carried out and enabled the collection of 4056 studies including 43 {QMRA} kept for analysis after screening. The latter emphasized Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. contaminations during the consumer stage as the main concern. The role of consumer handling on cross-contamination and undercooking events were of major concern. Thus, proper hygiene and safety practices by consumers have been suggested as the main intervention and would need to be followed with regular surveys to assess behavior changes and reduce knowledge gaps.},

	abstract = {This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2018 in 36 European countries (28 Member States ({MS}) and 8 non-{MS}). The ﬁrst and second most commonly reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The European Union ({EU}) trend for conﬁrmed human cases of these two diseases was stable during 2014–2018. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis was at the same level in 2018 as in 2017. Of the 27 reporting {MS}, 16 met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 11 {MS} failed meeting at least one. The {EU} ﬂock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased during recent years but stalled in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results from Competent Authorities for pig carcasses and for poultry tested through National Control Programmes were more frequently positive compared with food business operators. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ({STEC}) infections in humans were the third most commonly reported zoonosis in the {EU} and increased from 2014 to 2018. Yersiniosis was the fourth most frequently reported zoonosis in humans in 2018 with a stable trend in 2014–2018. The number of reported conﬁrmed listeriosis cases further increased in 2018, despite Listeria rarely exceeding the {EU} food safety limit tested in ready-to-eat food. In total, 5,146 food- and waterborne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the most commonly detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one in ﬁve outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and egg products was the highest risk agent/food pair. A large increase of human West Nile virus infections was reported in 2018. The report further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

In this era in which health news often sensationalizes uncommon infection syndromes or pathogens, the strains of E. coli that cause extraintestinal infection are an increasingly important endemic problem and underappreciated “killers”. Billions of health care dollars, millions of work days, and hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year to extraintestinal infections due to E. coli.

	abstract = {Campylobacter is a bacterium that can cause an illness called campylobacteriosis. With over 246,000 human cases annually, it is the most frequently reported foodborne illness in the {EU}. However, the actual number of cases is believed to be closer to nine million each year. The cost of campylobacteriosis to public health systems and to lost productivity in the {EU} is estimated by {EFSA} to be around €2.4 billion a year. Campylobacteriosis is a zoonotic disease – a disease or infection that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans. Usual symptoms are fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Raw poultry meat is often contaminated with Campylobacter since the bacterium can live in the intestines of healthy birds. It is also found in pigs and cattle. Eating undercooked chicken, or ready-to-eat foods that have been in contact with raw chicken, is the most common source of infection. In its assessments, {EFSA} has found that chickens and chicken meat may directly account for 20-30\% of human cases. Safe handling of raw meat and other raw food ingredients, thorough cooking and good kitchen hygiene can prevent or reduce the risk posed by contaminated food.

	abstract = {Campylobacter is among the most important agents of enteritis in developed countries. We have described the potential environmental determinants of the seasonal pattern of infection with campylobacter in Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Specifically, we investigated the role of climate variability on laboratory-confirmed cases of campylobacter infection from 15 populations. Regression analysis was used to quantify the associations between timing of seasonal peaks in infection in space and time. The short-term association between weekly weather and cases was also investigated using Poisson regression adapted for time series data. All countries in our study showed a distinct seasonality in campylobacter transmission, with many, but not all, populations showing a peak in spring. Countries with milder winters have peaks of infection earlier in the year. The timing of the peak of infection is weakly associated with high temperatures 3 months previously. Weekly variation in campylobacter infection in one region of the {UK} appeared to be little affected by short-term changes in weather patterns. The geographical variation in the timing of the seasonal peak suggests that climate may be a contributing factor to campylobacter transmission. The main driver of seasonality of campylobacter remains elusive and underscores the need to identify the major serotypes and routes of transmission for this disease.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastro-enteritis in the developed world. It is thought to infect 2–3 million people a year in the {US} alone, at a cost to the economy in excess of {US} \$4 billion. C. jejuni is a widespread zoonotic pathogen that is carried by animals farmed for meat and poultry. A connection with contaminated food is recognized, but C. jejuni is also commonly found in wild animals and water sources. Phylogenetic studies have suggested that genotypes pathogenic to humans bear greatest resemblance to non-livestock isolates. Moreover, seasonal variation in campylobacteriosis bears the hallmarks of water-borne disease, and certain outbreaks have been attributed to contamination of drinking water. As a result, the relative importance of these reservoirs to human disease is controversial. We use multilocus sequence typing to genotype 1,231 cases of C. jejuni isolated from patients in Lancashire, England. By modeling the {DNA} sequence evolution and zoonotic transmission of C. jejuni between host species and the environment, we assign human cases probabilistically to source populations. Our novel population genetics approach reveals that the vast majority (97\%) of sporadic disease can be attributed to animals farmed for meat and poultry. Chicken and cattle are the principal sources of C. jejuni pathogenic to humans, whereas wild animal and environmental sources are responsible for just 3\% of disease. Our results imply that the primary transmission route is through the food chain, and suggest that incidence could be dramatically reduced by enhanced on-farm biosecurity or preventing food-borne transmission.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, the primary agents of human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, are widespread in surface water. Several animal sources contribute to surface water contamination with Campylobacter, but their relative contributions thus far remained unclear. Here, the prevalence, genotype diversity, and potential animal sources of C. jejuni and C. coli strains in surface water in the Netherlands were investigated. It was also assessed whether the contribution of the different animal sources varied according to surface water type (i.e. agricultural water, surface water at discharge points of wastewater treatment plants [{WWTPs}], and official recreational water), season, and local livestock (poultry, pig, ruminant) density. For each surface water type, 30 locations spread over six areas with either high or low density of poultry, ruminants, or pigs, were sampled once every season in 2018-2019. Campylobacter prevalence was highest in agricultural waters (77\%), and in autumn and winter (74\%), and lowest in recreational waters (46\%) and in summer (54\%). In total, 76 C. jejuni and 177 C. coli water isolates were whole-genome sequenced. Most C. coli water isolates (78.5\%) belonged to hitherto unidentified clones when using the seven-locus sequence type ({ST}) scheme, while only 11.8\% of the C. jejuni isolates had unidentified {STs}. The origin of these isolates, as defined by core-genome multi-locus sequence typing ({cgMLST}), was inferred by comparison with Campylobacter strain collections from meat-producing poultry, laying hens, adult cattle, veal calves, small ruminants, pigs, and wild birds. Water isolates were mainly attributed to wild birds (C. jejuni: 60.0\%; C. coli: 93.7\%) and meat-producing poultry (C. jejuni: 18.9\%; C. coli: 5.6\%). Wild bird contribution was high among isolates from recreational waters and {WWTP} discharge points, and in areas with low poultry (C. coli) or high ruminant (C. jejuni) densities. The contribution of meat-producing poultry was high in areas with high density of poultry, springtime, agricultural waters and {WWTP} discharge points. While wild birds and poultry were the main contributors to Campylobacter contamination in surface water, their contribution differed significantly by water type, season, and local poultry and ruminant densities.},

	abstract = {The 2011 {EFSA} opinion on Campylobacter was updated using more recent scientific data. The relative risk reduction in {EU} human campylobacteriosis attributable to broiler meat was estimated for on-farm control options using Population Attributable Fractions ({PAF}) for interventions that reduce Campylobacter flock prevalence, updating the modelling approach for interventions that reduce caecal concentrations and reviewing scientific literature. According to the {PAF} analyses calculated for six control options, the mean relative risk reductions that could be achieved by adoption of each of these six control options individually are estimated to be substantial but the width of the confidence intervals of all control options indicates a high degree of uncertainty in the specific risk reduction potentials. The updated model resulted in lower estimates of impact than the model used in the previous opinion. A 3-log10 reduction in broiler caecal concentrations was estimated to reduce the relative {EU} risk of human campylobacteriosis attributable to broiler meat by 58\% compared to an estimate larger than 90\% in the previous opinion. Expert Knowledge Elicitation was used to rank control options, for weighting and integrating different evidence streams and assess uncertainties. Medians of the relative risk reductions of selected control options had largely overlapping probability intervals, so the rank order was uncertain: vaccination 27\% (90\% probability interval ({PI}) 4–74\%); feed and water additives 24\% (90\% {PI} 4–60\%); discontinued thinning 18\% (90\% {PI} 5–65\%); employing few and well-trained staff 16\% (90\% {PI} 5–45\%); avoiding drinkers that allow standing water 15\% (90\% {PI} 4–53\%); addition of disinfectants to drinking water 14\% (90\% {PI} 3–36\%); hygienic anterooms 12\% (90\% {PI} 3–50\%); designated tools per broiler house 7\% (90\% {PI} 1–18\%).

It has been shown using multilocus sequence typing that some clonal complexes (such as {ST}-45) are more frequently isolated from environmental sources such as water, suggesting that strains vary in their ability to survive in the environment. Although C. jejuni are fastidious microaerophiles generally unable to grow in atmospheric levels of oxygen, C. jejuni can adapt to survival in the environment, exhibiting aerotolerance and starvation survival. Bioﬁlm formation, the viable but nonculturable state, and interactions with other microorganisms can all contribute to survival outside the host. By exploiting high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and {RNA} Seq, we are well placed to decipher the mechanisms underlying the variations in survival between strains in environments such as soil and water and to better understand the role of environmental persistence in the transmission of C. jejuni directly or indirectly to humans.},

	abstract = {This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2017 in 37 European countries (28 Member States ({MS}) and nine non-{MS}). Campylobacteriosis was the commonest reported zoonosis and its {EU} trend for confirmed human cases increasing since 2008 stabilised during 2013–2017. The decreasing {EU} trend for confirmed human salmonellosis cases since 2008 ended during 2013–2017, and the proportion of human Salmonella Enteritidis cases increased, mostly due to one {MS} starting to report serotype data. Sixteen {MS} met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 12 {MS} failed meeting at least one. The {EU} flock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased or remained stable compared to 2016, and slightly increased in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results on pig carcases and target Salmonella serovar results for poultry from competent authorities tended to be generally higher compared to those from food business operators. The notification rate of human listeriosis further increased in 2017, despite Listeria seldom exceeding the {EU} food safety limit in ready-to-eat food. The decreasing {EU} trend for confirmed yersiniosis cases since 2008 stabilised during 2013–2017. The number of confirmed shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ({STEC}) infections in humans was stable. A total of 5,079 food-borne (including waterborne) outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the commonest detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one out of seven outbreaks, followed by other bacteria, bacterial toxins and viruses. The agent was unknown in 37.6\% of all outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and Salmonella in meat and meat products were the highest risk agent/food pairs. The report further summarises trends and sources for bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), West Nile virus and tularaemia.},

	abstract = {Campylobacteriosis is an important, worldwide public health problem with numerous socio-economic impacts. Since 2015, approximately 230,000 cases have been reported annually in Europe. In the United States, Australia and New Zealand, campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported disease. Poultry and poultry products are considered important sources of human infections. Poultry meat can become contaminated with Campylobacter during slaughter if live chickens are intestinal carriers. Campylobacter spp. can be transferred from animals to humans through consumption and handling of contaminated food products, with fresh chicken meat being the most commonly implicated food type. Regarding food-borne disease, the most important Campylobacter species are Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. In humans, clinical signs of campylobacteriosis include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Most cases of campylobacteriosis are sporadic and self-limiting, but there are post-infection complications, for example, Guillain-Barrés syndrome. This review summarizes an analysis undertaken by the {DISCONTOOLS} group of experts on campylobacteriosis. Gaps were identified in: (i) knowledge of true number of infected humans; (ii) mechanisms of pathogenicity to induce infection in humans; (iii) training to prevent transfer of Campylobacter from raw to ready-to-eat food; (iv) development of effective vaccines; (v) understanding transmission routes to broiler flocks; (vi) knowledge of bacteriocins, bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides as preventive therapies; (vii) ration formulation as an effective preventive measure at a farm level; (viii) development of kits for rapid detection and quantification of Campylobacter in animals and food products; and (ix) development of more effective antimicrobials for treatment of humans infected with Campylobacter. Some of these gaps are relevant worldwide, whereas others are more related to problems encountered with Campylobacter in industrialized countries.},

              Campylobacter jejuni
              is a major cause of bacterial food-borne infection in the industrial world. There is evidence that
              C. jejuni
              is present in eggs and hatchery fluff, opening the possibility for vertical transmission from hens to progeny. Poultry operations in Iceland provide an excellent opportunity to study this possibility, since breeding flocks are established solely from eggs imported from grandparent flocks in Sweden. This leaves limited opportunity for grandparents and their progeny to share isolates through horizontal transmission. While
              Campylobacter
              was not detected in all grandparent flocks, 13 of the 16 egg import lots consisted of eggs gathered from one or more
              Campylobacter
              -positive grandparent flocks. No evidence of
              Campylobacter
              was found by {PCR} in any of the 10 relevant quarantine hatchery fluff samples examined, and no
              Campylobacter
              was isolated from the parent birds through 8 weeks, while they were still in quarantine rearing facilities. After the birds were moved to less biosecure rearing facilities,
              Campylobacter
              was isolated, and 29 alleles were observed among the 224 isolates studied. While three alleles were found in both Sweden and Iceland, in no case was the same allele found both in a particular grandparent flock and in its progeny. We could find no evidence for vertical transmission of
              Campylobacter
              to the approximately 60,000 progeny parent breeders that were hatched from eggs coming from
              Campylobacter
              -positive grandparent flocks. If vertical transmission is occurring, it is not a significant source for the contamination of chicken flocks with
              Campylobacter
              spp.},

	abstract = {The Gram-negative bacterium Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the United States and many industrialized countries. Poultry, particularly chickens, is considered a major source of human campylobacteriosis. Thus, on-farm control of Campylobacter in poultry would reduce the risk of human exposure to this pathogen and have a signiﬁcant impact on food safety and public health. To date, three general strategies have been proposed to control Campylobacter in poultry at the farm level: (1) reduction of environmental exposure (biosecurity measures), (2) an increase in poultry’s host resistance to reduce Campylobacter carriage in the gut (e.g., competitive exclusion, vaccination, and host genetics selection), and (3) the use of antimicrobial alternatives to reduce and even eliminate Campylobacter from colonized chickens (e.g., bacteriophage therapy and bacteriocin treatment). Except for biosecurity measures, the other intervention approaches are currently not commercially available and are still under development. This review is focused on two promising strategies—vaccination and bacteriocin treatment. In particular, we extensively review recent research aimed at discovering and characterizing potent anti-Campylobacter bacteriocins to reduce Campylobacter load at the primary production level in poultry.},

	abstract = {The effect of phage therapy in the control of Campylobacter jejuni colonization in young broilers, either as a preventive or a therapeutic measure, was tested. A prevention group was infected with C. jejuni at day 4 of a 10-day phage treatment. A therapeutic group was phage treated for 6 days, starting 5 days after C. jejuni colonization of the broilers had been established. Treatment was monitored by enumerating Campylobacter colony forming units ({CFU}) and phage plaque forming units ({PFU}) from caecal content. Counts were compared with control birds not receiving phage therapy. A clear 3 log decline in C. jejuni counts was initially observed in the therapeutic group, however, after 5 days bacterial counts stabilized at a level 1 log lower than that of the control group. Colonization of C. jejuni in the prevention group was delayed by the treatment and after an initial 2 log reduction, colonization stabilized within a week at levels comparable to the therapeutic group. The {CFU} and {PFU} counts displayed opposing highs and lows over time, indicative of alternating shifts in ampliﬁcation of bacteria and phages. There were no adverse health effects from the phage treatment. Two different phages were combined as therapeutic treatment of Campylobacter positive chickens challenged at the age approaching broiler harvest. This again resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in Campylobacter colonization. We conclude that phage treatment is a promising alternative for reducing C. jejuni colonization in broilers.},

Methods: The medical records of all the consecutive patients with {CB} admitted to our hospital from 2000 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics, microbiologic and outcome data were collected.
Results: During the study period, 65 patients with {CB} were identified. The majority of the patients were middle aged and immune-compromised. Campylobacter jejuni was the most commonly identified species (33/47, 70\%). The main underlying conditions were haematological malignancies (43\%) and chronic liver disease (14\%). Fifty-seven percent of the patients were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the time of bacteraemia. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (85\%), diarrhoea (40\%), abdominal pain (40\%), and nausea and vomiting (40\%). Of the isolates tested, 97\% were susceptible to macrolides, and only 35\% were susceptible to quinolones. Susceptibility to quinolones decreased over the years. Most patients did not receive adequate empiric antibiotic treatment (81.5\%) and about 20\% never received directed therapy. Mortality and relapse rates were low (5\% each). There was no association between adequate empirical or definitive antibiotic therapy and adverse outcomes.
Conclusion: The main predisposing factor for Campylobacter bacteraemia in our cohort was immunosuppression. Prognosis was generally favourable regardless of appropriateness of antibiotic therapy.},

Flies were inoculated individually at their proboscis with 1.6 ϫ 107 {CFU} (colony forming units) of C. jejuni and incubated at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35{ЊC}. Furthermore, a dose experiment was conducted at 25{ЊC} where individual ßies were inoculated in three series: 6.5 ϫ 106, 6.0 ϫ 104, and 8.2 ϫ 102 C. jejuni {CFU}. Whole ßies were tested for C. jejuni carriage at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h by initial preenrichment in Bolton broth, which afterwards was streaked on {modiÞed} {mCCDA} agar plates and incubated under micro-aerobic conditions. The results showed that the time C. jejuni remained in ßies declined over time with ascending temperatures and when reducing the inoculation dose. All ßies stayed Campylobacter positive 24 h postinoculation at 15{ЊC} whereas only one-third of the ßies were positive at 20{ЊC} and few to none at 25, 30, and 35{ЊC}. When combinations of temperature and retention time were expressed as accumulated day-degrees, data could be adequately Þtted using a generalized linear mixed model that included a linear effect of day-degrees and the difference between the lowest and the two highest doses. Based on model predictions of selected combinations of temperature and dose, the time for 50\% and 1\% of ßies containing Campylobacter was calculated. It is suggested that house ßies are mainly short distance carriers of C. jejuni.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter is the leading cause of bacterial diarrhoeal disease worldwide, with raw and undercooked poultry meat and products the primary source of infection. Colonization of broiler chicken ﬂocks with Campylobacter has proved difﬁcult to prevent, even with high levels of biosecurity. Dipteran ﬂies are proven carriers of Campylobacter and their ingress into broiler houses may contribute to its transmission to broiler chickens. However, this has not been investigated in the {UK}. Campylobacter was cultured from 2195 ﬂies collected from four {UK} broiler farms. Of ﬂies cultured individually, 0·22\% [2/902, 95\% conﬁdence interval ({CI}) 0–0·53] were positive by culture for Campylobacter spp. Additionally, 1293 ﬂies were grouped by family and cultured in 127 batches: 4/127 (3·15\%, 95\% {CI} 0·11-6·19) from three broiler farms were positive for Campylobacter. Multilocus sequence typing of isolates demonstrated that the ﬂies were carrying broiler-associated sequence types, responsible for human enteric illness. Malaise traps were used to survey the dipteran species diversity on study farms and also revealed up to 612 ﬂies present around broiler-house ventilation inlets over a 2-h period. Therefore, despite the low prevalence of Campylobacter cultured from ﬂies, the risk of transmission by this route may be high, particularly during summer when ﬂy populations are greatest.},

	abstract = {Although a species' locomotor capacity is suggestive of its ability to escape global climate change, such a suggestion is not necessarily straightforward. Species vary substantially in locomotor capacity, both ontogenetically and within/among populations, and much of this variation has a genetic basis. Accordingly, locomotor capacity can and does evolve rapidly, as selection experiments demonstrate. Importantly, even though this evolution of locomotor capacity may be rapid enough to escape changing climate, genetic correlations among traits (often due to pleiotropy) are such that successful or rapid dispersers are often limited in colonization or reproductive ability, which may be viewed as a trade-off. The nuanced assessment of this variation and evolution is reviewed for well-studied models: salmon, flying versus flightless insects, rodents undergoing experimental evolution, and metapopulations of butterflies. This work reveals how integration of physiology with population biology and functional genomics can be especially informative.},

However, the role of the crop and excretory behavior of the house ßy in contamination of human food with {EHEC} is not known. In the current experiments, {EHEC} persisted in the crop of house ßies for at least 4 d. The number of {EHEC} in an excreted droplet was Ϸ104 1 h after bacterial feeding, Ͼ1.8 ϫ 105 3 h after feeding, and then drastically decreased after 24 h. Excretion is one of the major mechanisms for decreasing number of {EHEC} in the crop and gut of the house ßy. The frequency of excretion by females with developing eggs in their ovary was clearly higher (6.5 min per drop) than for males or females with mature eggs. Minute eosin-sign around a container Þlled with eosin-supplemented trypticase soy broth might be derived from frequent contact by house ßy contaminated mouthparts. These results show that frequent excretion potentially enhances the dissemination of {EHEC} to foods, particularly during the Þrst 24 h after ingestion of the bacteria.},

Study design From our national databases 2000-2010 and previous studies, we obtained the epidemiologic data to develop and validate system dynamics models. Population model incorporated birth rate and mortality. {KD} model incorporated the population at risk, incidence, and risk of coronary complications.
Results The average annual incidence in age group {\textless}5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 years was 67.3, 5.75, 0.79, and 0.26 per 100 000. The {KD} population was 23 349 and the model estimated 20 254 patients with {KD}, and 25\% of these patients received medical care or continued surveillance in 2010. Projection up to 2030 suggests an average of 725 new patients with {KD} annually and a {KD} population of 35 006 by 2030. In 2030, 1469 patients with {KD} will need medical care for coronary complications. Simulation on the model modiﬁed to {US} data is also effective and suggests an average of 6200 new patients annually and {KD} population of 161 776 by 2030, and 5664 patients will need coronary care in 2030. By 2030, there will be 1 per 700 people in Taiwan and 1 per 1600 in the {US} with a history of {KD}.

	abstract = {1 Calyptrate flies include numerous species that are disease vectors and have a high nuisance value, notably Musca domestica. Populations are often associated with livestock farms and domestic waste disposal facilities such as landfill, where the accumulating organic matter provides suitable breeding conditions for a range of species. 2 We examined the relationship between fly numbers and weather conditions using a 4-year data set of weekly fly catches from six sites in southern {UK}, together with meteorological data. The first 3 years were used to develop predictive models, and these were then used to forecast fly populations in the fourth year. The accuracy of these predictions was assessed by comparison with the actual fly catches for that year. Separate models were developed for M. domestica, Calliphora spp. and all calyptrate flies combined. 3 Predictions based only on humidity, temperature and rainfall were strongly correlated with observed data (r2 values ranged from 0·52 to 0·84), suggesting that fly population changes are largely driven by the weather rather than by biotic factors. We can forecast fly populations so that control measures need only be deployed when weather conditions are suitable for a fly outbreak, reducing the need for prophylactic insecticide use. 4 Climate change was simulated using the most recent predictions of future temperature increases. Our models predicted substantial increases in fly populations up to 244\% by 2080 compared with current levels, with the greatest increases occurring in the summer months. 5 Synthesis and applications. Models developed use weather data to predict populations of pestiferous flies such as M. domestica, which may prove valuable in integrated control programmes. These models predict substantial increases in fly populations in the future under likely scenarios of climate change. If this occurs we may expect considerable increases in the incidence of fly-borne disease.},
