	abstract = {This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2018 in 36 European countries (28 Member States ({MS}) and 8 non-{MS}). The ﬁrst and second most commonly reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The European Union ({EU}) trend for conﬁrmed human cases of these two diseases was stable during 2014–2018. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis was at the same level in 2018 as in 2017. Of the 27 reporting {MS}, 16 met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 11 {MS} failed meeting at least one. The {EU} ﬂock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased during recent years but stalled in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results from Competent Authorities for pig carcasses and for poultry tested through National Control Programmes were more frequently positive compared with food business operators. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ({STEC}) infections in humans were the third most commonly reported zoonosis in the {EU} and increased from 2014 to 2018. Yersiniosis was the fourth most frequently reported zoonosis in humans in 2018 with a stable trend in 2014–2018. The number of reported conﬁrmed listeriosis cases further increased in 2018, despite Listeria rarely exceeding the {EU} food safety limit tested in ready-to-eat food. In total, 5,146 food- and waterborne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the most commonly detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one in ﬁve outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and egg products was the highest risk agent/food pair. A large increase of human West Nile virus infections was reported in 2018. The report further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter is a bacterium that can cause an illness called campylobacteriosis. With over 246,000 human cases annually, it is the most frequently reported foodborne illness in the {EU}. However, the actual number of cases is believed to be closer to nine million each year. The cost of campylobacteriosis to public health systems and to lost productivity in the {EU} is estimated by {EFSA} to be around €2.4 billion a year. Campylobacteriosis is a zoonotic disease – a disease or infection that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans. Usual symptoms are fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Raw poultry meat is often contaminated with Campylobacter since the bacterium can live in the intestines of healthy birds. It is also found in pigs and cattle. Eating undercooked chicken, or ready-to-eat foods that have been in contact with raw chicken, is the most common source of infection. In its assessments, {EFSA} has found that chickens and chicken meat may directly account for 20-30\% of human cases. Safe handling of raw meat and other raw food ingredients, thorough cooking and good kitchen hygiene can prevent or reduce the risk posed by contaminated food.

Poultry meat is a widely consumed food in various forms, but it is also a reservoir of thermotolerant Campylobacter and Salmonella bacterial species. To assess human health risks associated with pathogenic bacteria in poultry meat, the use of quantitative microbial risk assessment ({QMRA}) has increased over the years as it is recognized to address complex food safety issues and is recommended by health authorities. The present project reviewed poultry meat {QMRA}, identified key steps of the farm-to-fork chain with significant impacts on food safety, highlighted current knowledge gaps, and provided risk mitigation advices. A {PRISMA} (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-based systematic analysis was carried out and enabled the collection of 4056 studies including 43 {QMRA} kept for analysis after screening. The latter emphasized Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. contaminations during the consumer stage as the main concern. The role of consumer handling on cross-contamination and undercooking events were of major concern. Thus, proper hygiene and safety practices by consumers have been suggested as the main intervention and would need to be followed with regular surveys to assess behavior changes and reduce knowledge gaps.},

Of particular concern are the species, C. jejuni and C. coli, which are responsible for most of these gastrointestinal-related infections. Although these organisms have already emerged as causative agents of zoonoses, several aspects of their epidemiology and pathophysiology are only beginning to emerge. Trends in increasing antibiotic resistance are beginning to emerge with oral antibiotics, which may be the drug of choice for when it is necessary to intervene chemotherapeutically.

We have described the potential environmental determinants of the seasonal pattern of infection with campylobacter in Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Specifically, we investigated the role of climate variability on laboratory-confirmed cases of campylobacter infection from 15 populations. Regression analysis was used to quantify the associations between timing of seasonal peaks in infection in space and time. The short-term association between weekly weather and cases was also investigated using Poisson regression adapted for time series data. All countries in our study showed a distinct seasonality in campylobacter transmission, with many, but not all, populations showing a peak in spring. Countries with milder winters have peaks of infection earlier in the year. The timing of the peak of infection is weakly associated with high temperatures 3 months previously. Weekly variation in campylobacter infection in one region of the {UK} appeared to be little affected by short-term changes in weather patterns. The geographical variation in the timing of the seasonal peak suggests that climate may be a contributing factor to campylobacter transmission. The main driver of seasonality of campylobacter remains elusive and underscores the need to identify the major serotypes and routes of transmission for this disease.},

	title = {Tracing the Source of Campylobacteriosis},
	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastro-enteritis in the developed world. It is thought to infect 2–3 million people a year in the {US} alone, at a cost to the economy in excess of {US} \$4 billion. C. jejuni is a widespread zoonotic pathogen that is carried by animals farmed for meat and poultry. A connection with contaminated food is recognized, but C. jejuni is also commonly found in wild animals and water sources. Phylogenetic studies have suggested that genotypes pathogenic to humans bear greatest resemblance to non-livestock isolates. Moreover, seasonal variation in campylobacteriosis bears the hallmarks of water-borne disease, and certain outbreaks have been attributed to contamination of drinking water. As a result, the relative importance of these reservoirs to human disease is controversial. We use multilocus sequence typing to genotype 1,231 cases of C. jejuni isolated from patients in Lancashire, England. By modeling the {DNA} sequence evolution and zoonotic transmission of C. jejuni between host species and the environment, we assign human cases probabilistically to source populations. Our novel population genetics approach reveals that the vast majority (97\%) of sporadic disease can be attributed to animals farmed for meat and poultry. Chicken and cattle are the principal sources of C. jejuni pathogenic to humans, whereas wild animal and environmental sources are responsible for just 3\% of disease. Our results imply that the primary transmission route is through the food chain, and suggest that incidence could be dramatically reduced by enhanced on-farm biosecurity or preventing food-borne transmission.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, the primary agents of human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, are widespread in surface water. Several animal sources contribute to surface water contamination with Campylobacter, but their relative contributions thus far remained unclear. Here, the prevalence, genotype diversity, and potential animal sources of C. jejuni and C. coli strains in surface water in the Netherlands were investigated. It was also assessed whether the contribution of the different animal sources varied according to surface water type (i.e. agricultural water, surface water at discharge points of wastewater treatment plants [{WWTPs}], and official recreational water), season, and local livestock (poultry, pig, ruminant) density. For each surface water type, 30 locations spread over six areas with either high or low density of poultry, ruminants, or pigs, were sampled once every season in 2018-2019. Campylobacter prevalence was highest in agricultural waters (77\%), and in autumn and winter (74\%), and lowest in recreational waters (46\%) and in summer (54\%). In total, 76 C. jejuni and 177 C. coli water isolates were whole-genome sequenced. Most C. coli water isolates (78.5\%) belonged to hitherto unidentified clones when using the seven-locus sequence type ({ST}) scheme, while only 11.8\% of the C. jejuni isolates had unidentified {STs}. The origin of these isolates, as defined by core-genome multi-locus sequence typing ({cgMLST}), was inferred by comparison with Campylobacter strain collections from meat-producing poultry, laying hens, adult cattle, veal calves, small ruminants, pigs, and wild birds. Water isolates were mainly attributed to wild birds (C. jejuni: 60.0\%; C. coli: 93.7\%) and meat-producing poultry (C. jejuni: 18.9\%; C. coli: 5.6\%). Wild bird contribution was high among isolates from recreational waters and {WWTP} discharge points, and in areas with low poultry (C. coli) or high ruminant (C. jejuni) densities. The contribution of meat-producing poultry was high in areas with high density of poultry, springtime, agricultural waters and {WWTP} discharge points. While wild birds and poultry were the main contributors to Campylobacter contamination in surface water, their contribution differed significantly by water type, season, and local poultry and ruminant densities.},

	abstract = {The 2011 {EFSA} opinion on Campylobacter was updated using more recent scientific data. The relative risk reduction in {EU} human campylobacteriosis attributable to broiler meat was estimated for on-farm control options using Population Attributable Fractions ({PAF}) for interventions that reduce Campylobacter flock prevalence, updating the modelling approach for interventions that reduce caecal concentrations and reviewing scientific literature. According to the {PAF} analyses calculated for six control options, the mean relative risk reductions that could be achieved by adoption of each of these six control options individually are estimated to be substantial but the width of the confidence intervals of all control options indicates a high degree of uncertainty in the specific risk reduction potentials. The updated model resulted in lower estimates of impact than the model used in the previous opinion. A 3-log10 reduction in broiler caecal concentrations was estimated to reduce the relative {EU} risk of human campylobacteriosis attributable to broiler meat by 58\% compared to an estimate larger than 90\% in the previous opinion. Expert Knowledge Elicitation was used to rank control options, for weighting and integrating different evidence streams and assess uncertainties. Medians of the relative risk reductions of selected control options had largely overlapping probability intervals, so the rank order was uncertain: vaccination 27\% (90\% probability interval ({PI}) 4–74\%); feed and water additives 24\% (90\% {PI} 4–60\%); discontinued thinning 18\% (90\% {PI} 5–65\%); employing few and well-trained staff 16\% (90\% {PI} 5–45\%); avoiding drinkers that allow standing water 15\% (90\% {PI} 4–53\%); addition of disinfectants to drinking water 14\% (90\% {PI} 3–36\%); hygienic anterooms 12\% (90\% {PI} 3–50\%); designated tools per broiler house 7\% (90\% {PI} 1–18\%).

It has been shown using multilocus sequence typing that some clonal complexes (such as {ST}-45) are more frequently isolated from environmental sources such as water, suggesting that strains vary in their ability to survive in the environment. Although C. jejuni are fastidious microaerophiles generally unable to grow in atmospheric levels of oxygen, C. jejuni can adapt to survival in the environment, exhibiting aerotolerance and starvation survival. Bioﬁlm formation, the viable but nonculturable state, and interactions with other microorganisms can all contribute to survival outside the host. By exploiting high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and {RNA} Seq, we are well placed to decipher the mechanisms underlying the variations in survival between strains in environments such as soil and water and to better understand the role of environmental persistence in the transmission of C. jejuni directly or indirectly to humans.},

	abstract = {This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2017 in 37 European countries (28 Member States ({MS}) and nine non-{MS}). Campylobacteriosis was the commonest reported zoonosis and its {EU} trend for confirmed human cases increasing since 2008 stabilised during 2013–2017. The decreasing {EU} trend for confirmed human salmonellosis cases since 2008 ended during 2013–2017, and the proportion of human Salmonella Enteritidis cases increased, mostly due to one {MS} starting to report serotype data. Sixteen {MS} met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 12 {MS} failed meeting at least one. The {EU} flock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased or remained stable compared to 2016, and slightly increased in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results on pig carcases and target Salmonella serovar results for poultry from competent authorities tended to be generally higher compared to those from food business operators. The notification rate of human listeriosis further increased in 2017, despite Listeria seldom exceeding the {EU} food safety limit in ready-to-eat food. The decreasing {EU} trend for confirmed yersiniosis cases since 2008 stabilised during 2013–2017. The number of confirmed shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ({STEC}) infections in humans was stable. A total of 5,079 food-borne (including waterborne) outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the commonest detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one out of seven outbreaks, followed by other bacteria, bacterial toxins and viruses. The agent was unknown in 37.6\% of all outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and Salmonella in meat and meat products were the highest risk agent/food pairs. The report further summarises trends and sources for bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), West Nile virus and tularaemia.},

	abstract = {Campylobacteriosis is an important, worldwide public health problem with numerous socio-economic impacts. Since 2015, approximately 230,000 cases have been reported annually in Europe. In the United States, Australia and New Zealand, campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported disease. Poultry and poultry products are considered important sources of human infections. Poultry meat can become contaminated with Campylobacter during slaughter if live chickens are intestinal carriers. Campylobacter spp. can be transferred from animals to humans through consumption and handling of contaminated food products, with fresh chicken meat being the most commonly implicated food type. Regarding food-borne disease, the most important Campylobacter species are Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. In humans, clinical signs of campylobacteriosis include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Most cases of campylobacteriosis are sporadic and self-limiting, but there are post-infection complications, for example, Guillain-Barrés syndrome. This review summarizes an analysis undertaken by the {DISCONTOOLS} group of experts on campylobacteriosis. Gaps were identified in: (i) knowledge of true number of infected humans; (ii) mechanisms of pathogenicity to induce infection in humans; (iii) training to prevent transfer of Campylobacter from raw to ready-to-eat food; (iv) development of effective vaccines; (v) understanding transmission routes to broiler flocks; (vi) knowledge of bacteriocins, bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides as preventive therapies; (vii) ration formulation as an effective preventive measure at a farm level; (viii) development of kits for rapid detection and quantification of Campylobacter in animals and food products; and (ix) development of more effective antimicrobials for treatment of humans infected with Campylobacter. Some of these gaps are relevant worldwide, whereas others are more related to problems encountered with Campylobacter in industrialized countries.},

Poultry, particularly chickens, is considered a major source of human campylobacteriosis. Thus, on-farm control of Campylobacter in poultry would reduce the risk of human exposure to this pathogen and have a signiﬁcant impact on food safety and public health. To date, three general strategies have been proposed to control Campylobacter in poultry at the farm level: (1) reduction of environmental exposure (biosecurity measures), (2) an increase in poultry’s host resistance to reduce Campylobacter carriage in the gut (e.g., competitive exclusion, vaccination, and host genetics selection), and (3) the use of antimicrobial alternatives to reduce and even eliminate Campylobacter from colonized chickens (e.g., bacteriophage therapy and bacteriocin treatment). Except for biosecurity measures, the other intervention approaches are currently not commercially available and are still under development. This review is focused on two promising strategies—vaccination and bacteriocin treatment. In particular, we extensively review recent research aimed at discovering and characterizing potent anti-Campylobacter bacteriocins to reduce Campylobacter load at the primary production level in poultry.},

              Campylobacter jejuni
              is a major cause of bacterial food-borne infection in the industrial world. There is evidence that
              C. jejuni
              is present in eggs and hatchery fluff, opening the possibility for vertical transmission from hens to progeny. Poultry operations in Iceland provide an excellent opportunity to study this possibility, since breeding flocks are established solely from eggs imported from grandparent flocks in Sweden. This leaves limited opportunity for grandparents and their progeny to share isolates through horizontal transmission. While
              Campylobacter
              was not detected in all grandparent flocks, 13 of the 16 egg import lots consisted of eggs gathered from one or more
              Campylobacter
              -positive grandparent flocks. No evidence of
              Campylobacter
              was found by {PCR} in any of the 10 relevant quarantine hatchery fluff samples examined, and no
              Campylobacter
              was isolated from the parent birds through 8 weeks, while they were still in quarantine rearing facilities. After the birds were moved to less biosecure rearing facilities,
              Campylobacter
              was isolated, and 29 alleles were observed among the 224 isolates studied. While three alleles were found in both Sweden and Iceland, in no case was the same allele found both in a particular grandparent flock and in its progeny. We could find no evidence for vertical transmission of
              Campylobacter
              to the approximately 60,000 progeny parent breeders that were hatched from eggs coming from
              Campylobacter
              -positive grandparent flocks. If vertical transmission is occurring, it is not a significant source for the contamination of chicken flocks with
              Campylobacter

	abstract = {The effect of phage therapy in the control of Campylobacter jejuni colonization in young broilers, either as a preventive or a therapeutic measure, was tested. A prevention group was infected with C. jejuni at day 4 of a 10-day phage treatment. A therapeutic group was phage treated for 6 days, starting 5 days after C. jejuni colonization of the broilers had been established. Treatment was monitored by enumerating Campylobacter colony forming units ({CFU}) and phage plaque forming units ({PFU}) from caecal content. Counts were compared with control birds not receiving phage therapy. A clear 3 log decline in C. jejuni counts was initially observed in the therapeutic group, however, after 5 days bacterial counts stabilized at a level 1 log lower than that of the control group. Colonization of C. jejuni in the prevention group was delayed by the treatment and after an initial 2 log reduction, colonization stabilized within a week at levels comparable to the therapeutic group. The {CFU} and {PFU} counts displayed opposing highs and lows over time, indicative of alternating shifts in ampliﬁcation of bacteria and phages. There were no adverse health effects from the phage treatment. Two different phages were combined as therapeutic treatment of Campylobacter positive chickens challenged at the age approaching broiler harvest. This again resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in Campylobacter colonization. We conclude that phage treatment is a promising alternative for reducing C. jejuni colonization in broilers.},

However, the role of the crop and excretory behavior of the house ßy in contamination of human food with {EHEC} is not known. In the current experiments, {EHEC} persisted in the crop of house ßies for at least 4 d. The number of {EHEC} in an excreted droplet was Ϸ104 1 h after bacterial feeding, Ͼ1.8 ϫ 105 3 h after feeding, and then drastically decreased after 24 h. Excretion is one of the major mechanisms for decreasing number of {EHEC} in the crop and gut of the house ßy. The frequency of excretion by females with developing eggs in their ovary was clearly higher (6.5 min per drop) than for males or females with mature eggs. Minute eosin-sign around a container Þlled with eosin-supplemented trypticase soy broth might be derived from frequent contact by house ßy contaminated mouthparts. These results show that frequent excretion potentially enhances the dissemination of {EHEC} to foods, particularly during the Þrst 24 h after ingestion of the bacteria.},

Species vary substantially in locomotor capacity, both ontogenetically and within/among populations, and much of this variation has a genetic basis. Accordingly, locomotor capacity can and does evolve rapidly, as selection experiments demonstrate. Importantly, even though this evolution of locomotor capacity may be rapid enough to escape changing climate, genetic correlations among traits (often due to pleiotropy) are such that successful or rapid dispersers are often limited in colonization or reproductive ability, which may be viewed as a trade-off. The nuanced assessment of this variation and evolution is reviewed for well-studied models: salmon, flying versus flightless insects, rodents undergoing experimental evolution, and metapopulations of butterflies. This work reveals how integration of physiology with population biology and functional genomics can be especially informative.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter is the leading cause of bacterial diarrhoeal disease worldwide, with raw and undercooked poultry meat and products the primary source of infection. Colonization of broiler chicken ﬂocks with Campylobacter has proved difﬁcult to prevent, even with high levels of biosecurity. Dipteran ﬂies are proven carriers of Campylobacter and their ingress into broiler houses may contribute to its transmission to broiler chickens. However, this has not been investigated in the {UK}. Campylobacter was cultured from 2195 ﬂies collected from four {UK} broiler farms. Of ﬂies cultured individually, 0·22\% [2/902, 95\% conﬁdence interval ({CI}) 0–0·53] were positive by culture for Campylobacter spp. Additionally, 1293 ﬂies were grouped by family and cultured in 127 batches: 4/127 (3·15\%, 95\% {CI} 0·11-6·19) from three broiler farms were positive for Campylobacter. Multilocus sequence typing of isolates demonstrated that the ﬂies were carrying broiler-associated sequence types, responsible for human enteric illness. Malaise traps were used to survey the dipteran species diversity on study farms and also revealed up to 612 ﬂies present around broiler-house ventilation inlets over a 2-h period. Therefore, despite the low prevalence of Campylobacter cultured from ﬂies, the risk of transmission by this route may be high, particularly during summer when ﬂy populations are greatest.},

Furthermore, a dose experiment was conducted at 25{ЊC} where individual ßies were inoculated in three series: 6.5 ϫ 106, 6.0 ϫ 104, and 8.2 ϫ 102 C. jejuni {CFU}. Whole ßies were tested for C. jejuni carriage at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h by initial preenrichment in Bolton broth, which afterwards was streaked on {modiÞed} {mCCDA} agar plates and incubated under micro-aerobic conditions. The results showed that the time C. jejuni remained in ßies declined over time with ascending temperatures and when reducing the inoculation dose. All ßies stayed Campylobacter positive 24 h postinoculation at 15{ЊC} whereas only one-third of the ßies were positive at 20{ЊC} and few to none at 25, 30, and 35{ЊC}. When combinations of temperature and retention time were expressed as accumulated day-degrees, data could be adequately Þtted using a generalized linear mixed model that included a linear effect of day-degrees and the difference between the lowest and the two highest doses. Based on model predictions of selected combinations of temperature and dose, the time for 50\% and 1\% of ßies containing Campylobacter was calculated. It is suggested that house ßies are mainly short distance carriers of C. jejuni.},

	abstract = {Each year, approximately 80,000 persons per year (range 30,000 – 160,000) are estimated to
experience symptoms of acute gastro-enteritis as a consequence of infection with
Campylobacter bacteria. On average 18,000 patients consult a general practitioner and 500
patients are hospitalised; for some 30 cases the disease could be fatal. Additionally, each year
some 1400 cases of reactive arthritis, 60 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and 10 cases of
inflammatory bowel disease are associated with a previous Campylobacter infection. The
disease burden and the cost-of-illness of Campylobacter infections and sequelae were
estimated using a stochastic simulation model. Disease burden was expressed in Disability
Adjusted Life Years ({DALYs}), the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability,
weighted for the severity of disease. Considered in the cost-of-illness were direct health-care
costs (e.g. doctors’ consultations, hospitalisation, rehabilitation), direct non-health-care costs
(e.g. travel costs of patients, co-payments by patients) and indirect non-health-care costs
(productivity losses), using cost estimates for the year 2000. The disease burden associated
with Campylobacter infections was estimated at 1200 {DALYs} per year, with a 90\%
uncertainty interval of between 900 and 1600 {DALYs} per year. The costs-of-illness were
estimated to total € 21 million per year with a 90\% confidence interval of between € 11
million and € 36 million per year. Hence, Campylobacter infections pose an important public
health problem for the Netherlands and incur substantial costs.},

Methods: The medical records of all the consecutive patients with {CB} admitted to our hospital from 2000 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics, microbiologic and outcome data were collected.
Results: During the study period, 65 patients with {CB} were identified. The majority of the patients were middle aged and immune-compromised. Campylobacter jejuni was the most commonly identified species (33/47, 70\%). The main underlying conditions were haematological malignancies (43\%) and chronic liver disease (14\%). Fifty-seven percent of the patients were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the time of bacteraemia. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (85\%), diarrhoea (40\%), abdominal pain (40\%), and nausea and vomiting (40\%). Of the isolates tested, 97\% were susceptible to macrolides, and only 35\% were susceptible to quinolones. Susceptibility to quinolones decreased over the years. Most patients did not receive adequate empiric antibiotic treatment (81.5\%) and about 20\% never received directed therapy. Mortality and relapse rates were low (5\% each). There was no association between adequate empirical or definitive antibiotic therapy and adverse outcomes.
Conclusion: The main predisposing factor for Campylobacter bacteraemia in our cohort was immunosuppression. Prognosis was generally favourable regardless of appropriateness of antibiotic therapy.},

Study design From our national databases 2000-2010 and previous studies, we obtained the epidemiologic data to develop and validate system dynamics models. Population model incorporated birth rate and mortality. {KD} model incorporated the population at risk, incidence, and risk of coronary complications.
Results The average annual incidence in age group {\textless}5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 years was 67.3, 5.75, 0.79, and 0.26 per 100 000. The {KD} population was 23 349 and the model estimated 20 254 patients with {KD}, and 25\% of these patients received medical care or continued surveillance in 2010. Projection up to 2030 suggests an average of 725 new patients with {KD} annually and a {KD} population of 35 006 by 2030. In 2030, 1469 patients with {KD} will need medical care for coronary complications. Simulation on the model modiﬁed to {US} data is also effective and suggests an average of 6200 new patients annually and {KD} population of 161 776 by 2030, and 5664 patients will need coronary care in 2030. By 2030, there will be 1 per 700 people in Taiwan and 1 per 1600 in the {US} with a history of {KD}.

The contribution of different animal reservoirs to surface water contamination with Campylobacter is largely unknown. In the Netherlands, the massive poultry culling to control the 2003 avian inﬂuenza epidemic coincided with a 44e50\% reduction in human campylobacteriosis cases in the culling areas, suggesting substantial environment-mediated spread of poultry-borne Campylobacter. We inferred the origin of surface water Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains in Luxembourg and the Netherlands, as deﬁned by multilocus sequence typing, by comparison to strains from poultry, pigs, ruminants, and wild birds, using the asymmetric island model for source attribution. Most Luxembourgish water strains were attributed to wild birds (61.0\%), followed by poultry (18.8\%), ruminants (15.9\%), and pigs (4.3\%); whereas the Dutch water strains were mainly attributed to poultry (51.7\%), wild birds (37.3\%), ruminants (9.8\%), and pigs (1.2\%). Attributions varied over seasons and surface water types, and geographical variation in the relative contribution of poultry correlated with the magnitude of poultry production at either the national or provincial level, suggesting that environmental dissemination of Campylobacter from poultry farms and slaughterhouses can be substantial in poultry-rich regions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Populations are often associated with livestock farms and domestic waste disposal facilities such as landfill, where the accumulating organic matter provides suitable breeding conditions for a range of species. 2 We examined the relationship between fly numbers and weather conditions using a 4-year data set of weekly fly catches from six sites in southern {UK}, together with meteorological data. The first 3 years were used to develop predictive models, and these were then used to forecast fly populations in the fourth year. The accuracy of these predictions was assessed by comparison with the actual fly catches for that year. Separate models were developed for M. domestica, Calliphora spp. and all calyptrate flies combined. 3 Predictions based only on humidity, temperature and rainfall were strongly correlated with observed data (r2 values ranged from 0·52 to 0·84), suggesting that fly population changes are largely driven by the weather rather than by biotic factors. We can forecast fly populations so that control measures need only be deployed when weather conditions are suitable for a fly outbreak, reducing the need for prophylactic insecticide use. 4 Climate change was simulated using the most recent predictions of future temperature increases. Our models predicted substantial increases in fly populations up to 244\% by 2080 compared with current levels, with the greatest increases occurring in the summer months. 5 Synthesis and applications. Models developed use weather data to predict populations of pestiferous flies such as M. domestica, which may prove valuable in integrated control programmes. These models predict substantial increases in fly populations in the future under likely scenarios of climate change. If this occurs we may expect considerable increases in the incidence of fly-borne disease.},

	abstract = {Climate change has strong effects on traits such as phenology and physiology. Studies typically assume that climate-induced trait changes will have consequences for population dynamics, but explicit tests are rare. Body condition reflects energy storage and may directly affect how much can be invested in reproduction and survival. However, the causal pathway by which decreased body condition impacts population dynamics has never been quantified across multiple populations and species. Therefore, we lack a general understanding of the consequences of changes in condition for variables more relevant for conservation, such as population size. Using structural equation modeling, we investigate how temperature-induced changes in body condition affect reproduction, and the subsequent impact on population growth rates of 19 bird species across 80 Dutch sites over a 21-year period. Warmer temperatures were associated with decreased body condition, which led to both decreased and increased reproduction at different sites, cancelling out any overall effect. The indirect effect of temperature on population growth (via body condition and reproduction) only explained within-species variation in the total effects of temperature on population growth. Instead, the direct effect of temperature on population growth (unrelated to condition and reproduction) was the most important pathway underlying the total effects of temperature on population growth, suggesting that unknown variables are mediating this effect. About half of the species are expected to increase under global warming, but this variation was not associated with any species characteristic. Overall, body condition responses to global warming are common, but their consequences on reproduction and subsequently population growth contribute relatively little to the total temperature impacts on population dynamics. Given that warming temperatures have strong effects on population dynamics, understanding the pathways via which temperature impacts population dynamics will be crucial for our ability to predict climate change effects in the future and improve conservation efforts.},

Here we assess and discuss key statements emerging from the rapidly developing study of changing spring phenology in migratory birds. These well-studied organisms have been instrumental for understanding climate-change effects, but research is developing rapidly and there is a need to attack the big issues rather than risking affirmative science. Although we agree poorly on the support for most claims, agreement regarding the knowledge basis enables consensus regarding broad patterns and likely causes. Empirical data needed for disentangling mechanisms are still scarce, and consequences at a population level and on community composition remain unclear. With increasing knowledge, the overall support (‘consensus view’) for a claim increased and between-researcher variability in support (‘expert opinions') decreased, indicating the importance of assessing and communicating the knowledge basis. A proper integration across biological disciplines seems essential for the field's transition from affirming patterns to understanding mechanisms and making robust predictions regarding future consequences of shifting phenologies.},

This damage is especially serious for the economically active population in Korea. From the societal perspective, it is therefore necessary to consider the economic impacts associated with liver diseases, and identify interventions that can reduce the burden of these diseases. The cost-of-illness study is considered to be an essential evaluation technique in health care. By measuring and comparing the economic burdens of diseases to society, such studies can help health-care decision-makers to set up and prioritize health-care policies and interventions. Using economic theories, this paper introduces various study methods that are generally applicable to most disease cases for estimating the costs of illness associated with mortality, morbidity, disability, and other disease characteristics. It also presents concepts and scopes of costs along with different cost categories from different research perspectives in cost estimations. By discussing the epidemiological and economic grounds of the cost-of-illness study, the reported results represent useful information about several evaluation techniques at an advanced level, such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and cost-utility analysis.},

	abstract = {Urban expansion is an increasing threat to biodiversity, especially in tropical Africa where biodiversity hot spots are being encroached upon by fast-growing cities. Threatened species include bees and other pollinators, which deliver important ecosystem services but are sensitive to land use changes. We investigated the impact of urbanisation and vegetation management practices on pollinator abundance, bee diversity, and bee functional traits. We sampled 126 locations in a stratified random design across an urbanisation gradient in two medium-sized cities in the West African Forests biodiversity hot spot, encompassing three management practices (farmed sites; amenity lands, i.e. green spaces managed for aesthetics; informal green spaces), and tested their effect with generalised linear models. Urbanisation did not affect bee abundances or diversity but had a negative impact on both wasp and beetle abundances. There was also a management-mediated impact of urbanisation on bee abundances, which decreased with urbanisation on farmed sites but not amenity land or informal green spaces. Management practices alone influenced bee abundances with farms harbouring fewer bees, and amenity lands fewer beetles. Bee genera occurrence and dominance patterns were influenced by both urbanisation and management, with some otherwise common genera rare in urban areas. Most functional traits were influenced by management, with fewer polylectic bees, cavity-nesting bees and long-tongued bees in farmed sites. Amenity lands hosted smaller bees and fewer savanna specialists. Some traits were influenced by urbanisation, with more long-tongued bees and cavity-nesting bees found in urban areas. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator responses to urbanisation are complex. In our research, we demonstrate how bee, lepidopteran, and non-fruit fly abundances have been maintained across an urbanisation gradient in tropical Africa, but not wasp and beetle abundances. Moreover, bee community composition and the distribution of traits shifted markedly. How green spaces were managed was also critical. We found that farmed sites hosted the lowest bee abundances and amenity lands the fewest beetles. Retaining informal green spaces and amenity lands in African cities, including protecting nesting sites for stingless bees, and limiting pesticide application would be important for conserving bees and the pollination service they provide to both crops and native vegetation.},

              In many countries relatively high notification rates of campylobacteriosis are observed in children under 5 years of age. Few studies have considered the role that environmental exposure plays in the epidemiology of these cases. Wild birds inhabit parks and playgrounds and are recognized carriers of
              Campylobacter
              , and young children are at greater risk of ingesting infective material due to their frequent hand-mouth contact. We investigated wild-bird fecal contamination in playgrounds in parks in a New Zealand city. A total of 192 samples of fresh and dried fecal material were cultured to determine the presence of
              Campylobacter
              spp.
              Campylobacter jejuni
              isolates were also characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ({PFGE}) and multilocus sequence typing ({MLST}), and the profiles obtained were compared with those of human isolates.
              C. jejuni
              was isolated from 12.5\% of the samples. {MLST} identified members of clonal complexes {ST}-45, {ST}-682, and {ST}-177; all of these complexes have been recovered from wild birds in Europe. {PFGE} of {ST}-45 isolates resulted in profiles indistinguishable from those of isolated obtained from human cases in New Zealand. Members of the {ST}-177 and {ST}-682 complexes have been found in starlings (
              Sturnus vulgaris
              ) in the United Kingdom, and these birds were common in playgrounds investigated in New Zealand in this study. We suggest that feces from wild birds in playgrounds could contribute to the occurrence of campylobacteriosis in preschool children. Further, the
              C. jejuni
              isolates obtained in this study belonged to clonal complexes associated with wild-bird populations in the northern hemisphere and could have been introduced into New Zealand in imported wild garden birds in the 19th century.},

	abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that age and size at maturity of organisms should be influenced by time and food constraints on development. This study investigated phenotypic plasticity in growth, development, body size, and diapause in the yellow dung fly, Scathophaga stercoraria. Full-sib families were allowed to develop under predator-free field conditions. The time before the onset of winter was varied and each brood was split into three environments differing in the amount of dung a set number of larvae had as a resource. When resources were abundant and competition was minimal, individuals of both sexes grew to larger body sizes, took longer time to mature, and were able to increase their growth rates to attain large body sizes despite shorter effective development periods later in the season. In contrast, limited larval resources and strong competition constrained individuals to mature earlier at a smaller adult size, and growth rates could not be increased but were at least maintained. This outcome is predicted by only two life-history optimality models, which treat mortality due to long development periods and mortality due to fast growth as independent. Elevated preadult mortality indicated physiological costs of fast growth independent of predation. When larval resources were limited, mortality increased with heritable variation in development time for males, and toward the end of the season mortality increased as larval resources became more abundant because this induced longer development periods. Sexual and fecundity selection favoring large body size in this species is thus opposed by larval viability selection favoring slower growth in general and shorter development periods when time and resources are limited; this overall combination of selective pressures is presumably shaping the reaction norms obtained here. Flexible growth rates are facilitated by low genetic correlations between development time and body size, a possible consequence of selection for plasticity. Heritable variation was evident in all traits investigated, as well as in phenotypic plasticity of these traits (genotype X interactions). This is possibly maintained by unpredictable spatiotemporal variation in dung abundance, competition, and hence selection.},

System dynamics modeling uses feedback theory and computer-aided simulation to help elucidate relationships between factors in complex systems, which may be circular or interrupted with long delays. Materials used to build the simulator include data from literature and industry indices. The methods used were the steps in {SDM}, namely: 1) Identify the problem and boundaries; 2) develop a dynamic hypothesis explaining cause of the problem; 3) build the causal loop diagram ({CLD}); 4) develop the stock and flow model; 5) conduct model simulations; and 6) model validation. Results presented here are the {CLD} and stock and flow model of the simulator, results of scenario simulations, and model validity tests. The simulator consists of the main model, the disease submodel, and the antimicrobial use submodel. The main model represents a cycle of production in the broiler house of a specified length of time, which repeats after a specified down time. The disease submodel shows population dynamics in the broiler house in terms of changes over time in number of susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead birds. Production parameters that could be modified in the model include delivery size, grow-out period, down time, and efficacy of antimicrobials. Disease mortality levels, above the set threshold, trigger antimicrobial use in the model. The model showed the effect of antimicrobial use intervention on the population dynamics, namely, on the proportion of the susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead birds in the population. Thus, the {BHDMS} was able to simulate the effect of the intervention on population dynamics and would facilitate evaluating management interventions such as antimicrobial use.},

A quantitative description of the dose-response relation for Campylobacter jejuni with the Beta-Poisson model was fitted to experimental data of infection with Campylobacter jejuni (as determined by shedding of C. jejuni) obtained in human feeding studies performed by Black et al. (1988). The maximum likelihood estimates for the Beta-Poisson model parameters based on these data are: B = 0.145 and B = 7.59. The fit of the model on the experimental data was good: the difference between the likelihood obtained with the Beta-Poisson model and the maximum possible likelihood was not significant. The occurrence of symptoms of intestinal illness did not follow a similar dose-related trend. Overall, 22\% of the infected volunteers developed symptoms (diarrhea, fever). The highest illness-toinfection ratio was found at an intermediate dose (9 x 104). The dose-response relation and the illness-to-infection ratio appeared to differ between different C. jejuni isolates. The dose-response relation derived from feeding studies with a single isolate should therefore be considered indicative. The absence of experimental data in the low dose range resulted in a relatively large confidence interval at low doses. However, in cases where the dose-response relation has been applied so far to estimate the health risk of exposure to C. jejuni in water, the uncertainty in the dose-response relation was insignificant compared to the uncertainty in the exposure estimate.},

	abstract = {Consumption of contaminated drinking water is a signiﬁcant cause of Campylobacter infections. Drinking water contamination is known to result from septic seepage and wastewater intrusion into non-disinfected sources of groundwater and occasionally from cross-connection into drinking water distribution systems. Wastewater efﬂuents, farm animals and wild birds are the primary sources contributing human-infectious Campylobacters in environmental waters, impacting on recreational activities and drinking water sources. Culturing of Campylobacter entails time-consuming steps that often provide qualitative or semi-quantitative results. Viable but non-culturable forms due to environmental stress are not detected, and thus may result in false-negative assessments of Campylobacter risks from drinking and environmental waters. Molecular methods, especially quantitative {PCR} applications, are therefore important to use in the detection of environmental Campylobacter spp. Processing large volumes of water may be required to reach the desired sensitivity for either culture or molecular detection methods. In the future, applications of novel molecular techniques such as isothermal ampliﬁcation and high-throughput sequencing applications are awaited to develop and become more affordable and practical in environmental Campylobacter research. The new technologies may change the knowledge on the prevalence and pathogenicity of the different Campylobacter species in the water environment.},

	abstract = {Tag-based ethnocentric cooperation is a highly robust behavior which can evolve and prevail under a wide variety of conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated, however, that ethnocentrism can temporarily be suppressed by other competing strategies, especially in its early evolutionary stages. In a series of computational experiments, conducted with an agent-based evolutionary model of tag-mediated cooperation, we addressed the question of whether a stochastically established and once dominant non-ethnocentric strategy such as indiscriminate altruism can stably persist and permanently outweigh ethnocentrism. Our model, simulated on various complex network topologies, employs simple haploid genetics and asexual reproduction of computational agents equipped with memory and heritable phenotypic traits. We find that in combination with an implemented memory mechanism and tags, random bias acting in favor of altruists can lead to their long-lasting victory over all other types of strategists. The difference in density between altruistic and ethnocentric cooperators increases with greater rewiring of the underlying network, but decreases with growing population size. These findings suggest that randomness plays an important role in promoting non-ethnocentric cooperation and contributes to our understanding of how other than adaptive mechanisms can initiate the design of novel behavioral phenotypes, thereby shaping surprisingly new evolutionary pathways.},

	abstract = {Logistic slaughter is an intervention measure intended to reduce cross-contamination during slaughter by slaughtering contaminated units (=(groups of) animals) last. This paper describes a simple mathematical model which predicts the prevalences of contaminated units after logistic and random-order slaughter. The effect of logistic slaughter is the difference between these prevalences. The model assumes that uncontaminated units can become contaminated by contaminated units that were slaughtered before them; the contributions of contaminated units are independent. It also assumes that a slaughterhouse is uncontaminated at the start of the day and that a unit that is contaminated before slaughter also is contaminated after slaughter. The model was analysed using numerical simulations; for a selection of cases, analytical formulas can be derived and are presented. Contamination of broiler flocks with Salmonella was used as a case study. Even for this simple model, data availability is a problem leading to uncertain parameter estimates. An average cross-contamination scenario predicts that the beneficial effect of logistic slaughter is as low as 9.1\%, which casts doubt on its usefulness as an intervention measure. The case study produced these general model results: the effect of logistic slaughter increases with the probability of cross-contamination between units; with the length of the slaughter queue; and with sensitivity (the probability of a positive test from a unit contaminated at the start of slaughter). However, the effect is small if the prevalence of contaminated units before slaughter is low or high.},

The problem that is modelled can be reasonably well defined, but it can also take the form of an ill-defined or messy problem, i.e., a situation in which opinions in a management team differ considerably. These messy managerial situations are difficult to handle, primarily because thus far little theoretical work has been conducted to shed more light on the question why these messy situations exist and why it may be difficult for a management team to reach agreement. This article fills this theoretical gap by drawing on literature from sociology, (social) psychology and small-group research. Insights from this literature are discussed and translated into guidelines for conducting Group Model-Building projects for messy problems. The article ends with the conclusion that system dynamicists should include Group Model-Building and facilitation training in their teaching programs. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The effects of {UV} irradiation at a wavelength of 254 nm on the survival of Campylobacter jejuni on the surfaces of broiler meat, skin, and carcasses were studied. On broiler carcasses, the effects of {UV} were also studied in combination with activated oxygen. The surfaces were inoculated with varying counts of C. jejuni and treated with {UV} irradiation using doses ranging between 9.4 and 32.9 {mW}/s per square centimeter. The log reductions in C. jejuni counts were determined by dilution plating. The effects of both treatments on the sensory quality of broiler meat, including visual appearance, odor, and fatty acid composition, were also evaluated. On broiler meat, the maximum reduction achieved was 0.7 log and on broiler skin 0.8 log. On broiler carcasses, the maximum reduction using {UV} irradiation was 0.4 log, and using {UV} in combination with activated oxygen 0.4 log. No significant differences were found in the sensory quality between the samples and the controls. The use of {UV} irradiation alone or in combination with activated oxygen cannot be recommended as a primary decontamination method for C. jejuni on broiler carcasses. The use of these methods in combination with other decontamination techniques, and processing with proper processing plant sanitation and hygiene, might be more effective in reducing the C. jejuni counts on broiler carcass surfaces than the use of these methods only.},

@book{bresser_effects_2006,
	title = {The effects of climate change in the Netherlands},
	abstract = {The changing climate in the Netherlands is seen in, for example, the rising sea level, the increase in discharge of rivers and the response of nature to temperature changes. Although the observed effects in the Netherlands are limited without having led to serious problems for the country, climate change and its effects are expected to accelerate over the next few decades and persist for a considerable length of time.

The second half of the century may see serious problems arising from climate change, in particular in the low-lying areas of the country. A sea level rise of several to many metres is expected in the very long term (a few hundred years). It is questionable whether conventional techniques can be used to maintain the current level of safety. Greater effort will also be required to uphold this safety level due to the additional problems of possible increase in discharge from the rivers Rhine and Meuse and further land subsidence.

Climate

The average temperature will almost certainly further increase (1 to 6°C in 100 years). Dry and extremely warm summers (as in 2003) will be more frequent; the probability of extremely cold winters will decrease, although the famous 'Eleven Cities' skating tour may take place occasionally. Heavy rainfalls may also increase in frequency.

Water

River discharge is likely to increase considerably due to more extreme temperatures and precipitation events. As a result, safety will be at stake and river discharges excessive in the low-lying regions in the Netherlands by the end of the century.

Nature

The rate at which the temperature rises will probably be too high to enable many species to adapt or migrate. Several plant and animal species are threatened with extinction in the Netherlands, whereas new species will settle if they can migrate quickly enough. The net effect will probably be a decrease in species diversity in the Netherlands.

Economic losses

The agricultural and tourism sectors will undergo changes that could be both positive and negative from an economic point of view. This will depend partly on developments elsewhere in Europe. There are signs that agricultural damage risks (water logging, droughts and insects) are increasing. Cooling-water problems and limitations on navigation (as in the summer of 2003) will increase if water management does not improve.

Public health

Temperature rise caused by climate change may have a direct negative influence on human health in the Netherlands. Possible effects of climate change are: problems due to heat stress, an increasing spread of Lyme disease, poor air quality (summer smog) and an increase in allergies. Risk groups in the population (such as the elderly, children or people with asthma) could experience greater effects (e.g. a greater disease burden).

Measures

To respond adequately to these projected influences, climate change has, to a certain extent, already been taken into account in various policies in the Netherlands. Water management policy, for example, now seriously considers climate change by taking technical and spatial planning measures. Technical measures include raising the height of dykes, expanding the capacity of pumping stations and intensifying beach nourishment to maintain sand levels along the coast. Spatial planning measures include accommodating flood storage areas.},

Locomotor activity was measured for both sexes and at four densities (with mixed sexes) during a full light and dark (L:D) cycle at temperatures ranging from 10 to 40{ЊC}. Locomotor activity during daytime increased with temperature at all densities until reaching 30{ЊC} and then decreased. Highdensity treatments {signiÞcantly} reduced the locomotor activity per ßy, except at 15{ЊC}. For both sexes, daytime activity also increased with temperature until reaching 30 and 35{ЊC} for males and females, respectively, and thereafter decreased. Furthermore, males showed a {signiÞcantly} higher and more predictable locomotor activity than females. During nighttime, locomotor activity was considerably lower for all treatments. Altogether the results of the current study show that there is a {signiÞcant} interaction of temperature and density on daytime locomotor activity of M. domestica and that houseßies are likely to show {signiÞcant} changes in locomotor activity with change in temperature.},

At constant laboratory temperatures, growth rates were maximal between 15°C and 20°C and decreased at higher (25°C) and lower (10°C) temperatures, while the development rate was maximal at 25°C. Perhaps related to this, yellow dung ¯ies reached a given size faster at naturally variable, as opposed to constant, temperatures. In the ®eld, lower temperatures towards the end of the season resulted in larger individuals that grew faster. Adult body size increased as development time, expressed in calendar days, increased, a positive relationship commonly taken for granted in life history theory, but decreased as development time expressed in degree-days increased. The eect of temperature on growth, development and body size can thus change or even reverse if individuals can alter their growth rate independently of development time, and if the physiological eects of temperature are factored out by converting development time into degree-days above a lower development threshold. Therefore, supposedly well-established trends possibly need to be re-examined along these lines. Pupal winter diapause towards the end of the season was highly reversible by temperature. Pre- and post-winter emergence patterns together suggest that the minimum time for yellow dung ¯ies to successfully complete development, at any time of the year, is about 230±250 degree-days.},

	title = {Modelling of a zoonotic pathogen (Campylobactor) in a Dairy herd.},
	abstract = {Zoonotic pathogens such as Campylobactor are a major contributor of human disease
notifications in countries with agricultural economies, such as New Zealand. Understanding the mechanisms
by which Campylobactor persist in animal reservoirs is key to designing effective intervention strategies. A
model of Campylobacter transmission within a dairy herd was developed based on a Susceptible-{InfectedRecovered} ({SIR}) modelling framework. The model incorporates stages of disease progression and includes a
compartment (W) that tracks Campylobacter concentration in the environment. The model was used to
perform simulations but is yet to be tested against observed data. Threshold parameters for invasion such as
the basic reproduction number, R0 were estimated to be about 0.19, indicating that one infectious individual
would on average infect 0.19 susceptible animals and the disease would thus not be able to establish itself.
The variation of short term dynamics with epidemiological parameters was examined. The model has been
developed with a long-term view of understanding and incorporating seasonal and climate change factors.
Methods for incorporating these factors into the model are discussed.},
