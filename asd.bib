	abstract = {Species within the genus, Campylobacter, have emerged over the last three decades as significant clinical pathogens, particularly of human public health concern, where the majority of acute bacterial enteritis in the Western world is due to these organisms. Of particular concern are the species, C. jejuni and C. coli, which are responsible for most of these gastrointestinal-related infections. Although these organisms have already emerged as causative agents of zoonoses, several aspects of their epidemiology and pathophysiology are only beginning to emerge. Trends in increasing antibiotic resistance are beginning to emerge with oral antibiotics, which may be the drug of choice for when it is necessary to intervene chemotherapeutically. This review wishes to examine (i) emerging clinical aspects of the disease, such as Guillain Barré syndrome ({GBS}), (ii) the association between these organisms and poultry as a natural host, (iii) environmental aspects of Campylobacter epidemiology, (iv) the emergence of atypical campylobacters (v) emerging trends in antibiotic resistance, (vi) adoption of modern methods for the detection of campylobacters.},

	abstract = {Food of animal origin, especially meat products, represent the main vehicle of foodborne pathogens and so are implicated in foodborne outbreaks. Poultry meat is a widely consumed food in various forms, but it is also a reservoir of thermotolerant Campylobacter and Salmonella bacterial species. To assess human health risks associated with pathogenic bacteria in poultry meat, the use of quantitative microbial risk assessment ({QMRA}) has increased over the years as it is recognized to address complex food safety issues and is recommended by health authorities. The present project reviewed poultry meat {QMRA}, identified key steps of the farm-to-fork chain with significant impacts on food safety, highlighted current knowledge gaps, and provided risk mitigation advices. A {PRISMA} (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-based systematic analysis was carried out and enabled the collection of 4056 studies including 43 {QMRA} kept for analysis after screening. The latter emphasized Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. contaminations during the consumer stage as the main concern. The role of consumer handling on cross-contamination and undercooking events were of major concern. Thus, proper hygiene and safety practices by consumers have been suggested as the main intervention and would need to be followed with regular surveys to assess behavior changes and reduce knowledge gaps.},

	abstract = {This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2018 in 36 European countries (28 Member States ({MS}) and 8 non-{MS}). The ﬁrst and second most commonly reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The European Union ({EU}) trend for conﬁrmed human cases of these two diseases was stable during 2014–2018. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis was at the same level in 2018 as in 2017. Of the 27 reporting {MS}, 16 met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 11 {MS} failed meeting at least one. The {EU} ﬂock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased during recent years but stalled in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results from Competent Authorities for pig carcasses and for poultry tested through National Control Programmes were more frequently positive compared with food business operators. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ({STEC}) infections in humans were the third most commonly reported zoonosis in the {EU} and increased from 2014 to 2018. Yersiniosis was the fourth most frequently reported zoonosis in humans in 2018 with a stable trend in 2014–2018. The number of reported conﬁrmed listeriosis cases further increased in 2018, despite Listeria rarely exceeding the {EU} food safety limit tested in ready-to-eat food. In total, 5,146 food- and waterborne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the most commonly detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one in ﬁve outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and egg products was the highest risk agent/food pair. A large increase of human West Nile virus infections was reported in 2018. The report further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli is probably the best-known bacterial species and one of the most frequently isolated organisms from clinical specimens. Despite this, underappreciation and misunderstandings exist among medical professionals and the lay public alike regarding E. coli as an extraintestinal pathogen. Underappreciated features include (i) the wide variety of extraintestinal infections E. coli can cause, (ii) the high incidence and associated morbidity, mortality, and costs of these diverse clinical syndromes, (iii) the pathogenic potential of different groups of E. coli strains for causing intestinal versus extraintestinal disease, and (iv) increasing antimicrobial resistance. In this era in which health news often sensationalizes uncommon infection syndromes or pathogens, the strains of E. coli that cause extraintestinal infection are an increasingly important endemic problem and underappreciated “killers”. Billions of health care dollars, millions of work days, and hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year to extraintestinal infections due to E. coli. New treatments and prevention measures will be needed for improved outcomes and a diminished disease burden.},
