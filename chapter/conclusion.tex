\textcolor{red}{Answer the research question from the intro}
\subsection{2.	What is the wider significance of what was found?}
\textcolor{red}{What are the policy recommendations from this analysis?}
\subsection{3.	Suggestions for further research}
\textcolor{red}{What are the limitations of the model (in terms of conceptualisation, specification, validation, and analysis?}
%Validation limitation = no validation with SME.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Expand the cost of illness and health impacts to look at health system capacity
    \item Explicitly model sub-components of DALYs for different population compositions to understand implications of aging population
    \item Model human infection from environment in more detail
    \item Reduce uncertainty by conducting household behavioural surveys before and after campylobacter infection
\end{itemize}
