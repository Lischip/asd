\subsection{Why System Dynamics?}
System dynamics is a method of understanding socio-technical systems in the context of their structure, with the underlying belief that effects observed in systems are caused by their system structure \parencite{pruyt_triple_2013}. System dynamics is a suitable choice for the modelling of \textit{Campylobacter} transmission and subsystem effects on healthcare, environment and economic impacts due to the ability to test policy choices in the form of changes to system structures and causal relationships.

\textbf{Model Structure}



\textbf{Model boundaries}

This model draws wider boundaries than Rommens' original model. Here, the focus is on climate, population, and policy effects (both on production and consumption) and the subsequent economic impacts of these factor. As a result, some internal components of the model were simplified. Specifically, operational components related to transmissions occurring on individual farms, broilers, and slaughterhouses were aggregated into a single submodel, allowing for more focus on environmental transmission pathways.

The sub-model of 'Infected Chickens' encompasses the majority of Rommen's original model. Details of the structure and behaviour of this sub-model are detailed in the following sections.

This analysis contains five main sub-models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Environmental: This sub-model focuses on environmental transmission routes and influences for \textit{Campylobacter}, particularly through surface waters and disease vectors (flies and birds other than poultry). According to recent reports by the RIVM, environmental transmission was the second most prevalent cause of \textit{Campylobacter} infections in the Netherlands in 2019. The sub-model also includes levers for climate influences on these transmission pathways.
    \item Contaminated surface water: Significant to the Environmental transmission subsystem, this subsystem has been modelled separately to allow for the more complex hydrodynamics and more specific inputs required to model water-borne transmission pathways.
    \item Infected people: This sub-model focuses on the stock-flow structure for infected individuals, and goes into more detail on morbidity and mortality associated with these individuals.
    \item Infected chickens: This sub-model is based primarily on the work by Rommens. It is a simplified stock-flow model of her original work, designed to replicate key behaviours and interactions.
    \item Cost of illness: This sub-model tracks the impacts and probabilities of \textit{Campylobacter} infections leading to serious illness and fatality, including the relative cost of illness, to reflect economic effects of human \textit{Campylobacter} infections.

\end{itemize}

This sub-model (presented in Figure X) is a simplification of Rommens' 2020(SOURCE) model of dynamics of transmission in farms, broilers and slaughterhouses. It is represented in our model as a stock-flow structure in which healthy chickens become infected chickens with \textit{Campylobacter} at the 'infection with \textit{Campylobacter}' rate. These infected chickens then become contaminated chicken meat when \textit{Campylobacter} positive chickens are slaughtered. Healthy chickens  contaminated chicken meat stock via '\textit{Campylobacter} negative chickens being slaughtered with cross-contamination. The contaminated chicken meat stock is reduced as contaminated chicken meat is consumed. The population of healthy chickens are also reduced by thinning, represented by the flow variable '\textit{Campylobacter} negative chickens slaughtered without contamination'.

Other internal variables in this model included probabilities of infection, concentration of \textit{Campylobacter} in surface water, propagation of disease vectors, and climate effects all influence internal probabilities, with the exact values for these rates detailed in Appendix X.
