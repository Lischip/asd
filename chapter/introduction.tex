Although Campylobacter is regarded as a primal cause of foodborne diseases in Europe \parencite{european_food_safety_authority_european_2019}
, its (possible) economic impact has been understudied. The \citeauthor{european_food_safety_authority_campylobacter_nodate} estimates that the burden on health care and the loss of productivity caused by the pathogen in the European Union to be around \euro{} 2.4 billion a year.  %It has been shown that E. Coli burdens the health care of the United States, and costs billions of dollars \textcite{russo_medical_2003}

 I'M CALLING UUUUUU


This project is part of the course EPA1341 Advanced System Dynamics. The project will expand upon prior research conducted on the topic of \textit{Campylobacter}, a bacteria often found in poultry which causes diarrhoeal disease in humans. Adding to existing research, the economic impact of policy measures aimed to prevent the spread of  \textit{Campylobacter} and the effect climate change has will be explored. In order to analyse different policy measures, the programming environment of Vensim is used.
