Although Campylobacter is regarded as a primal cause of foodborne diseases in Europe \parencite{european_food_safety_authority_european_2019}
, its (possible) economic impact has been understudied. The \citeauthor{european_food_safety_authority_campylobacter_nodate} estimates that the burden on health care and the loss of productivity caused by the pathogen in the European Union to be around \euro{} 2.4 billion a year. %It has been shown that E. Coli burdens the health care of the United States, and costs billions of dollars \textcite{russo_medical_2003}

Campylobacteriosis appears to be the most frequent type of bacterial gastro-enteritis in the developed world \cite{fouts_major_2005}. Common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramp, nausea, vomiting and fever for durations of 5-7 days. In recent years, annual cases of campylobacteriosis in the Netherlands total up to 73 000 \cite{lagerweij_disease_2020}, although its milder symptoms give reason to speculate that a significant amount remain unreported\cite{koutsoumanis_update_2020}. EU wide roughly 30\% of campylobacteriosis cases resulted in hospitalisation (REF).

The main source of human infections occur through food-borne transmission routes via consumption of of livestock meat, mainly poultry \cite{wilson_tracing_2008}. The bacteria are highly adapted to live and colonize the intestinal tracts of avian species and other animals, yet cause little to no clinical disease symptoms \cite{saif_diseases_2008}. 

%Transmission chicken-to human, and current monitoring/policies
During the chicken meat production process
Current interventions have focussed on...
-> better hygiene
-> vaccination
-> reduced thinning

%Temperature
In the EU, the variation in Campylobacter prevalence has been from 0.6 \% to 13.1\% in Scandinavia, up to 74.2\%–80\% in  several  other  countries

%Surface waters
While campylobacter grow optimally at range of 37–42 °C \cite{bronowski_role_2014} in anaerobic conditions, they can survive ex vivo in surface waters.

This project is part of the course EPA1341 Advanced System Dynamics. The project will expand upon prior research conducted on the topic of \textit{Campylobacter}, a bacteria often found in poultry which causes diarrhoeal disease in humans. Adding to existing research, the economic impact of policy measures aimed to prevent the spread of  \textit{Campylobacter} and the effect climate change has will be explored. In order to analyse different policy measures, the programming environment of Vensim is used.
