Campylobacter is regarded as a primal cause of foodborne diseases in Europe \parencite{european_food_safety_authority_european_2019}. Despite this, its economic impact has been understudied. The \citeauthor{european_food_safety_authority_campylobacter_nodate} estimates that the costs of sickness and the cost of loss of productivity caused by the pathogen is around \euro{} 2.4 billion a year in the European Union. Common symptoms of campylobacteriosis include diarrhea, abdominal cramp, nausea, vomiting and fever for durations of 5-7 days.  Although the symptoms of the infection by the \emph{Campylobacter} (called Campylobacteriosis) are mild for most, a portion will need to take absence of work, or continue to work at a suboptimal level.

In 2019, the estimated total number of cases of campylobacteriosis in the Netherlands were estimated to be around 73\,000 \parencite{lagerweij_disease_2020}, although due its milder symptoms it is speculated that a significant amount remained unreported \parencite{koutsoumanis_update_2020}.

%Campylobacteriosis is the most frequent type of bacterial gastro-enteritis in the developed world \parencite{fouts_major_2005}. Common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramp, nausea, vomiting and fever for durations of 5-7 days. In 2017, EU wide 240\,000 campylobacteriosis cases were reported, with roughly 30\%  resulting in hospitalisation. \parencite{european_centre_for_disease_prevention_and_control_european_2018}. In 2019, annual cases of campylobacteriosis in the Netherlands totaled up to 73\,000 \parencite{lagerweij_disease_2020}, although due its milder symptoms it is speculated that a significant amount remained unreported \parencite{koutsoumanis_update_2020}.

%Transmission routes during chicken meat production
The main cause of human infections occur through food-borne transmission routes via consumption of of livestock meat, mainly poultry \parencite{wilson_tracing_2008}. The bacteria are highly adapted to live and colonize the intestinal tracts of avian species and other mammals, yet cause little to no clinical disease symptoms to these animals \parencite{saif_diseases_2008}. Contamination occurs during stages of the chicken meat production chain. During primary production production on farms the pathogen is spread from various locations due to unhygienic handling, which can leave on residues on clothes, boots, forklifts, transportation crates, etc. The periodic partial depopulation of the flock, a.k.a "thinning" has been shown to contribute to this spread between these locations. While transportation to the slaughterhouses seems to only have a limited effect on the contamination of the chickens, plucking and  evisceration within slaughterhouses do lead to contamination of carcasses, which is how \textit{Campylobacter} ultimately lands on the surface of sold meat \parencite{skarp_campylobacteriosis_2015}.

%Transmission routes in the environment
Spread between flocks, as evidence suggest, occurs virtually only through horizontal transmission, rather than vertical transmission (i.e. from parent to child) (Callicott et al., 2006). \textit{Campylobacter} can be easily spread from animal to animal through a variety of environmental routes, like contact with infected faeces \parencite{}





Non-human transmissions routes, exacerbate the spread among poultry. While campylobacter grow optimally at range of 37–42 °C \cite{bronowski_role_2014} in anaerobic conditions, they can survive ex vivo in water \cite{wilson_tracing_2008}. \textit{Campylobacter} has shown to survive in surface waters for... DURATION.
Via disease vectors such as insects, mice and other vermin it can them be spread amongt flocks, even from farm to farm. !!!(REF)!!!

% animal excrement, sewage

%Interventions
Current interventions are focused at a farm level. By educating farmers how to employ better bio-security measures at farm level such as restricting access to rearing houses and installing hygiene barriers, transfer from the outside environment is reduced. Another intervention measure deals with with abandoning thinning of flocks during the rearing period, because this procedure increases the transfer of \textit{Campylobacter} into the flock
    % - Vaccination
    % - Antimicrobials
    
%Current results of these interventions


%Scientific gap
%Certain environmental transmission routes remain under-investigated
%How environmental conditions affect campy proliferation (temperature)
In the EU, the variation in \textit{Campylobacter} prevalence has been from 0.6 \% to 13.1\% in Scandinavia, up to 74.2\%–80\% in several other countries of central and eastern Europe \cite{skarp_campylobacteriosis_2015} 
















This project is part of the course EPA1341 Advanced System Dynamics. The project will expand upon prior research conducted on the topic of \textit{Campylobacter}, a bacteria often found in poultry which causes diarrhoeal disease in humans. Adding to existing research, the economic impact of policy measures aimed to prevent the spread of  \textit{Campylobacter} and the effect climate change has will be explored. In order to analyse different policy measures, the programming environment of Vensim is used.
